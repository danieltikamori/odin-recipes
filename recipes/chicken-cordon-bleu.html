    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound chicken cutlets, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>⅔ cup almond flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup avocado oil</li>
        <li>¼ pound shaved deli ham</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Combine almond flour, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken cutlets into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Dredge with almond flour mixture, then set on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices are running clear, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Place chicken cutlets on a baking sheet. Top with slices of ham and cover with shredded Swiss cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
